### Expected result

<img src="./design/desktop-preview.jpg" width="800px">

## Actual result

- Desktop
  <br />
  <img src="./design/desktop-result.png" width="800px" />

  <img src="./design/ipad-mini.png" width="55%" />
  <img src="./design/iphone-se-result.png" width="42%" />

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS media queries
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Nothing in particular.

### Continued development

Practicing responsiveness, especially regarding font sizes, is something I still haven't mastered and it takes up a lot of time during development.

### Useful resources

- [Color Picker](https://snapcraft.io/color-picker) - It helped me to get a more accurate representation of the colors that were not provided.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - It provided the main font used in the project.
- [Optimizilla](https://imagecompressor.com/) - To optimize the screenshots.
